### Introduction
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes
### Objective
To predict the count of bikes rented per hour using a regression model
### Dataset used
The dataset contains count of public bikes rented at each hour in Seoul Bike haring System with the corresponding Weather data and Holidays information. It is available at UCI Machine Learning Repository. The link to the dataset is : databases/00560Parent DirectorySeoulBikeData.csv
The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.
We wish to analyse the data and fit a proper model to the dataset
